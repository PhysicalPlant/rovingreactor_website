                The Concept

                    On the Wednesday of this year's Nuclear Science Week, we want to fill 20 dining rooms across America with thoughtful people from the nuclear energy ecosystem for an evening of hot soup and meaningful conversation about where nuclear energy is headed and how to tell its story.
                </p >
                <p>

                    Also it's a chance for people from different habitats of nuclear to meet each other: A night to connect with fellow travelers from research, regulation, builders & operators (from welders to CEOs), investment, advocacy, and education, and a chance to explore common ground while respectfully acknowledging different perspectives on nuclear's future.
