              The Roving Reactor Project is building a coalition that includes
              advocacy groups, government agencies (especially the national
              labs), academia, and industry. The list below is aspirational.
              We&apos;ll continue to reach out to these phenomenal institutions

              is an artist from Austin, Texas where he runs{" "}
              <a href="https://physicalplant.org/about/">Physical Plant Arts</a>
              . Now in its 30th year, the company&apos;s work has been featured
              in the New York Times, American Theatre Magazine, Variety, and
              elsewhere. Along the way, Steve spent 10 years at IBM, first as a

              Since 2022, Steve has conducted 100 interviews with experts in
              energy and conservation. As the capabilities of nuclear energy
              came into focus in those conversations, the idea for the Roving
              Reactor project was born: a traveling exhibit designed to educate
              and encourage action on nuclear as a vital component in the
              struggle to balance our need for energy with the need to preserve
              and protect the natural world.
