    <p><strong>This Atomic World</strong> was a traveling educational program that brought nuclear science into American high schools. A fleet of vans equipped with scientific instruments toured the country. Students experimented with Geiger counters, cloud chambers, and Van de Graaff generators, making abstract atomic principles tangible.</p>
    <p>By the early 1960s, the program had reached thousands of schools, inspiring a new generation of scientists and engineers interested in nuclear technology.</p>
